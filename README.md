# Overview
This repository contains an advanced car sales dashboard created using Power BI. The dashboard offers a comprehensive view of car sales performance by leveraging powerful data visualization techniques and advanced analytics. It enables businesses to monitor and evaluate their sales activities effectively, facilitating data-driven decision-making. By integrating multiple data sources, the dashboard provides real-time insights into various aspects of car sales, including sales trends, performance metrics, and key performance indicators (KPIs).
The dashboard's interactive features allow users to drill down into specific data points, customize views according to their needs, and gain a deeper understanding of sales performance across different regions, car models, and customer segments. With detailed Profit and Loss (P&L) reports by Fiscal Year, Markets, and Months, businesses can evaluate their financial performance, identify growth opportunities, and make informed decisions to optimize their sales strategies.
